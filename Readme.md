# Cookie Solution

Hi, please unzip the file, enter the root directory and run in terminal

    npm i

to install the project.

## How to start the project

In the root directory run in terminal

    npm start

to use the Cookie Solution tool.

## How to launch tests

To run tests written with Playwright, go to the root directory and run in terminal

    npx test

## My work

I developed a vanilla JS class for the functionality, with a simple css based on TailwindCSS.
Tests e2e are written with Playwright.
I used Webpack as module bundler and to run the dev server.
The compiled bundle can be included in the <head> or in the <body> too.

## Did I enjoy the job?

I had some difficulties to configure Webpack and to write the tests because unfortunately we rarely use them in office.
I worked for the task about 7/8 hours. I know, it's a long time.. but I had the opportunity to study some tools that are quite new to me and I had a lot of fun!

## What would I have done if I had more time?

I would rewrite the JS class to make it more clean and readable.
For sure I will study testing tools and solutions, I'm not expert in tests and this makes me very angry.

## Thanks

Thank you for this opportunity.
Whatever happens I had fun, I learned something new and I know better what I have to study tomorrow.
